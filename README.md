With this Project my goal was to see just how far my skills have come scince week one of siege. the "original" game was my FIRST project for siege and also my first real stab at Godot. the new one me recreating it now. Pretty big difference, huh? 
I tried to keep most of the oroginal art, e.g. the timeMap, and player, but some of it (like Mario) was so bad i had to throw it out and replace it

First game:
	You play as a coin who is running away from Mario, trying not to be collected.
	Shift to sprint.
	you can not win D:

New game:
	You play as a coin who is running away from Mario, trying not to be collected (again)
	There are 2 levels, to progress through them you jump into the question mark ([?]) blocks.



Controlls are as follows:
	WASD or arrows to move. (You can also use space to jump)
	umm.. yea thats pretty much all of the controlls. its just a platformer so there's not much in the way of coontrolls
